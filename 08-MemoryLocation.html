    <h1>Memory Location</h1>
    <p>Understanding how values are assigned to variables is crucial in programming. In JavaScript, values are stored in
        memory locations, and variables point to those locations. Below is a diagram to help visualize this concept:</p>

    <img src="../images/code-execution-in-javascript.svg"
        alt="Illustration of memory allocation and variable assignment in JavaScript" width="40%" height="30%"><br><br>

    <p>The image above shows how variables store values in memory during execution. For example, when you assign a value
        to a variable, like the following:</p>

    <code><pre>
        const age = 12;
        const songName = 'DanzaKuduro';
    </pre></code>

    <h4>Explanation:</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>When JavaScript runs, it allocates memory to store variables. It doesn't need to know how many variables
            there are in advance. It creates memory slots (addresses) to hold values as the code executes.</li>
        <li>Then the JavaScript engine assigns values to these memory slots.</li>
        <li>For primitive types (like numbers, strings, booleans), the value itself is stored in the variable. When you
            assign one variable to another, it copies the actual value.</li>
        <li>For objects (like arrays and functions), the variable stores a reference (memory address) to the location
            where the object is stored, not the object itself.</li>
        <li>When you compare objects, JavaScript checks if the memory addresses (references) are the same. Even if two
            objects have the same content, they might not be the same object if they are stored at different memory
            locations.</li>
        <li>This is also a reason why we can access a function before defining it, but with variables, this doesn't
            work.</li>
    </ol>

    <script>
        const age = 12;
        const songName = 'DanzaKuduro';
    </script>
