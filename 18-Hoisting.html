  <h1>What is hosting?</h1>
  <p>JavaScript hoisting is a behavior where the declarations of functions, variables, and classes are moved to the top
    of their scope during the memory creation phase, before the actual execution of the code</p>
  <h2>Hoisting is like moving your toys to the top of the shelf before you play with them</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Variables and functions</strong> are like your toys. When you write your code, JavaScript moves your
      toys (variables and functions) to the top of your shelf (the top of the code) before you even start playing with
      them.</li>
    <li>But here's the thing :<br>
      <ul>
        <li>With <strong>var</strong>, JavaScript moves your toy to the top and says, "I see this toy, but I don’t know
          what it is yet!" So, when you try to play with it, it’s like saying "undefined" because the toy has no name
          yet.</li>
        <li>With <strong>let</strong> and <strong>const</strong>, JavaScript moves them to the top, but they are like
          toys stuck in a special "waiting zone"(Temporal Dead Zone). You can't play with them until you tell JavaScript
          what they are (their value). If you try to play with them too early, you’ll get an error.</li>
        <li><strong> Functions</strong> are like your toys that are already fully ready to play with. When you define a
          function, it's like you’ve already packed and placed your toy at the top of the shelf, so you can play with it
          anytime!
        </li>
        <code><pre>
sayHello();  // This works!

function sayHello() {
  console.log("Hello!");
}
            </pre></code>
        <li><strong>What happens:</strong> You can call the function sayHello() before even writing it down in the code,
          because JavaScript moves it to the top, all ready to use!</li>
      </ul>
      </br>
    </li>
    <li>So, hoisting is just a way JavaScript organizes things behind the scenes, but it can be confusing when you try
      to use something too early!</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Function-expression</h2>
  <p>A function expression in JavaScript is a way to define a function as part of an expression. It can be assigned to a
    variable, passed as an argument to other functions, or returned from another function. The key point is that the
    function is not declared with the function keyword at the top level, but rather as part of an expression.</p>
  <code>
      <pre>

1. Named Function Expression:

const someRandomVariable = function sayHello() {
console.log("Hello!");    
};

This is a named function expression. The function is assigned to the someRandomVariable variable, and it has the name sayHello internally. This name is useful for debugging, but it's not used when invoking the function because it's assigned to the variable.
        
2. Anonymous Function Expression:

const RandomVariable1 = function (){  // This works! // if we don't want to name it it’s Ok
console.log("Hello!");
}

Or we can define it like

RandomVariable1 (function(){
  console.log("bharat Meta Ki Jai ")
})

This is an anonymous function expression, meaning the function does not have a name. It's simply assigned to the variable someRandomVariable1. You can call it like this: someRandomVariable1();
        
3. Function Expression with Parameters:
const greet = function(name) {
    return `Hello, ${name}!`;
};

This is a function expression with a parameter (name). It returns a greeting string using the value of name
</pre>
    </code>
  <h3>Note:</h3>
  <p>here we saw three type of Function Expression there is something else that we should remember which is called
    Function Declaration</p>
  <p>when we declare a function like this its called Function Declaration</p>
  <code><pre>
Function Declaration

function hiMessage(name){
console.log(`Hii, My name is ${name}`);
}
</pre></code>
