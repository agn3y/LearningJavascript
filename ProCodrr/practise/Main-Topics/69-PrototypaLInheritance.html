    <h1>Prototypal Inheritance Using Extends and Super Keyword</h1>
    <p>no matter whatever object is there the prototype chain always ends at object</p>
    <p>arrays only ave 2 level prototype chain</p>
    <p>we must maintain order while Using super and constrcutors beacuse the values get passed down in order</p>
    <p>if there are two method with same name and we want to use one of them then bydefault whichever property is closest will be called first the methods will be inherited but the closer one will be called first that's all. if it din't find that method than it will refer to method which will be inherited</p>
